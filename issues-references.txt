build issues with maven :
=============================
observation : in windows 10

for docker spotify maven plugin,

the docker build with spotify have issue in building image, version 1.2.0 maven plugin
with docker Docker version 18.09.1, build 4c52b90 in windows with linux container.

work around ->

(1) in docker desktop settings -> enabled "Expose daemon on tcp:\\localhost:2375 without TLS"
(2) run below environment settings before using mvn clean install for not skipping docker building
	please create a bat file and run the settings before running mvn clean install.
	
	set the settings i gave in .bat file
	set DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375
	set DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=default
	set DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
	set DOCKER_CERT_PATH=C:\Users[userid].docker\machine\machines\default

	and run the mvn install for spotify docker

========================

the artifactid you use for the image or repository should be all case sensitive (small) if we use caps we will get build image issue
this is observed after even setting the bat file. refer above.
